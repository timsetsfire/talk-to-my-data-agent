## 🚀 Quick Start

### Quickstart with DataRobot CLI

#### 1. Install the DataRobot CLI

If you haven't already, install the DataRobot CLI by following the installation instructions at:  
https://github.com/datarobot-oss/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

#### 2. Start the Application

Run the following command to start the Talk To My Data application. An interactive wizard will guide you through the selection of configuration options, including creating a `.env` file in the root directory and populating it with environment variables you specify during the wizard.

```sh
dr start
```

The DataRobot CLI (`dr`) will:
- Guide you through configuration setup
- Create and populate your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables
- Deploy your application to DataRobot
- Display a link to your running application when complete

When deployment completes, the terminal will display a link to your running application.\
👉 **Click the link to open and start using your app!**

Additionally, please find a guided Talk To My Data walkthrough [here](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/get-started/gs-dr5/talk-data-walk.html).

### Build in Codespace

If you're using **DataRobot Codespace**, everything you need is already installed.
Follow the steps below to launch the entire application in just a few minutes.

Use the built-in terminal on the left sidebar of the Codespace.

From the project root:

```sh
dr start
```

When deployment completes, the terminal will display a link to your running application.\
👉 **Click the link to open and start using your app!**

Additionally, please find a guided Talk To My Data walkthrough [here](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/get-started/gs-dr5/talk-data-walk.html).

### Template Development

For local development, follow all of the steps below.

#### 1. Install Pulumi (if you don’t have it yet)

If Pulumi is not already installed, follow the installation instructions in the Pulumi [documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/).
After installing for the first time, **restart your terminal** and run:

```sh
pulumi login --local      # omit --local to use Pulumi Cloud (requires an account)
```

#### 2. Clone the Template Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/datarobot-community/talk-to-my-data-agent.git
cd talk-to-my-data-agent
```

#### 3. Create and Populate Your `.env` File
This command generates a `.env` file from `.env.template` to walk you through the required credentials setup automatically.
```sh
dr dotenv setup
```
If you want to locate the credentials manually:

- DataRobot API Token:
  See Create a DataRobot API Key in the [DataRobot API Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#create-a-datarobot-api-key).

- DataRobot Endpoint:
  See Retrieve the API Endpoint in the same [Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#retrieve-the-api-endpoint).

- LLM Endpoint & API Key (Azure OpenAI):
  Refer to the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cjavascript-keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-python#retrieve-key-and-endpoint) for your resource and deployment values.

#### 4. Develop the Template

See the [React Frontend Development Guide](app_frontend/README.md) and [FastAPI Backend Development Guide](app_backend/README.md). 

Run the following to deploy or update your application:
```bash
source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
pulumi up
```
Alternatively, run the following command for a simpler setup:

```sh
python quickstart.py YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
# Windows users may need:  py quickstart.py YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` with any name you prefer, then press **Enter**.

When deployment completes, the terminal will display a link to your running application.\
👉 **Click the link to open and start using your app!**

**What does `quickstart.py` do?**

The quickstart script automates the entire setup process for you:

- Creates and activates a Python virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies (using `uv` for faster installation, falling back to `pip`)
- Loads your `.env` configuration
- Sets up the Pulumi stack with your project name
- Runs `pulumi up` to deploy your application
- Displays your application URL when complete

This single command replaces all the manual steps described in the [advanced setup section](#setup-for-advanced-users).

Python 3.10 - 3.12 are supported

Advanced users desiring control over virtual environment creation, dependency installation, environment variable setup
and `pulumi` invocation see [here](#setup-for-advanced-users).

## Prerequisites

If you are using DataRobot Codespaces, this is already complete for you. If not, install:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python package manager)
- [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) (task runner)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18+ (for React frontend)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) (infrastructure as code)

## User's Guide

The basic usage of the app is straightforward. The user uploads one or more structured files to the application, starts a chat and asks questions about those files.
Behind the scenes, the LLM configured for the application translates the user's question into code, the application runs the code and again sends the results to
an LLM to generate analysis and visualizations. Because the dataset is loaded into the application itself, this limits the size of the data that can be analyzed.
The application can support larger datasets and connect to remote data stores through the DataRobot platform, described below.

### Connecting to Data Stores in the DataRobot Platform

When a user of the application is a DataRobot user (see [this documentation](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-apps/custom-apps/nxt-manage-custom-app.html#share-applications)
for sharing applications) and has data stores configured in the DataRobot platform (see [this page for configuring data stores](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/platform/acct-settings/nxt-data-connect.html)
and [this page for details on supported data stores](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/reference/data-ref/data-sources/index.html))
of a supported connection (currently Postgres and Redshift), these will appear in the application as a "Remote Data Connection" (see screenshot below).
These DataStores will be queried via DataRobot's data wrangling platform ([see documentation](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-dataprep/wb-wrangle-data/wb-sql-editor.html)).
Unlike the app's bespoke database integration (see [Change the database](#change-the-database)), a data store will not be visible to all users of the app, only to those who have access to
the data store and its default credentials in the DataRobot platform.

## Architecture overview

![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datarobot_public/drx/ttmd2-schematic.jpg)

App templates contain three families of complementary logic:

- **AI logic**: Necessary to service AI requests and produce predictions and completions.
  ```
  deployment_*/  # Chat agent model
  ```
- **App Logic**: Necessary for user consumption; whether via a hosted front-end or integrating into an external consumption layer.
  ```
  frontend/  # Streamlit frontend
  app_frontend/  # React frontend alternative with the api located in app_backend
  utils/  # App business logic & runtime helpers
  ```
- **Operational Logic**: Necessary to activate DataRobot assets.
  ```
  infra/__main__.py  # Pulumi program for configuring DataRobot to serve and monitor AI and app logic
  infra/  # Settings for resources and assets created in DataRobot
  ```

## Why build AI Apps with DataRobot app templates?

App Templates transform your AI projects from notebooks to production-ready applications. Too often, getting models into production means rewriting code, juggling credentials, and coordinating with multiple tools and teams just to make simple changes. DataRobot's composable AI apps framework eliminates these bottlenecks, letting you spend more time experimenting with your ML and app logic and less time wrestling with plumbing and deployment.

- Start building in minutes: Deploy complete AI applications instantly, then customize the AI logic or the front-end independently (no architectural rewrites needed).
- Keep working your way: Data scientists keep working in notebooks, developers in IDEs, and configs stay isolated. Update any piece without breaking others.
- Iterate with confidence: Make changes locally and deploy with confidence. Spend less time writing and troubleshooting plumbing and more time improving your app.

Each template provides an end-to-end AI architecture, from raw inputs to deployed application, while remaining highly customizable for specific business requirements.

## Data privacy

Your data privacy is important to us. Data handling is governed by the DataRobot [Privacy Policy](https://www.datarobot.com/privacy/), please review before using your own data with DataRobot.

## Make changes

### Change the LLM

1. Modify the `LLM` setting in `infra/settings_generative.py` by changing `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_4_O` to any other LLM from the `LLMs` object.
   - Trial users: Please set `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_4_O_MINI` since GPT-4o is not supported in the trial. Use the `OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID` in `.env` to override which model is used in your Azure organization. You'll still see GPT 4o-mini in the playground, but the deployed app will use the provided Azure deployment.
2. To use an existing TextGen model or deployment:
   - In `infra/settings_generative.py`: Set `LLM=LLMs.DEPLOYED_LLM`.
   - In `.env`: Set either the `TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID` or the `TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID`
   - In `.env`: Set `CHAT_MODEL_NAME` to the model name expected by the deployment (e.g. "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" for an anthropic deployment,"datarobot-deployed-llm" for NIM models )
   - (Optional) In `utils/api.py`: `ALTERNATIVE_LLM_BIG` and `ALTERNATIVE_LLM_SMALL` can be used for fine-grained control over which LLM is used for different tasks.

### Use [DataRobot LLM Gateway](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/gen-ai/genai-code/dr-llm-gateway.html)

The application supports using the DataRobot LLM Gateway instead of bringing your own LLM credentials.

#### **Credential Priority**

The application follows this priority order for LLM selection:

1. **OpenAI Credentials** (Highest Priority) - If `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`, etc. are provided in `.env`, they will always be used regardless of the `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY` setting
2. **LLM Gateway** - If `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=true` and no OpenAI credentials are provided

#### **Setup**

**Important**: Remove or comment out `OPENAI_*` environment variables to use DataRobot's LLM Gateway

1. In `.env`: Set `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=true`
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### **When LLM Gateway is enabled:**

- No hardcoded LLM credentials (OpenAI keys) are required in your `.env` file
- The LLM Gateway provides a unified interface to multiple LLM providers through DataRobot in production
- You can pick from the catalog and change the model `LLM` in `infra/settings_generative.py`
- It will use a DataRobot Guarded RAG Deployment and LLM Blueprint for that selected model

**Note**: LLM Gateway mode requires consumption based pricing is enabled for your DataRobot account as is evidenced by the `ENABLE_LLM_GATEWAY` feature flag.
Contact your administrator if this feature is not available.

1. In `.env`: If not using an existing TextGen model or deployment, provide the required credentials dependent on your choice.
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

> **⚠️ Availability information:**
> Using a NIM model requires custom model GPU inference, a premium feature. You will experience errors by using this type of model without the feature enabled. Contact your DataRobot representative or administrator for information on enabling this feature.

### Change the database

#### Snowflake

To add Snowflake support:

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "snowflake"`.
2. Provide snowflake credentials in `.env` by either setting `SNOWFLAKE_USER` and `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` or by setting `SNOWFLAKE_KEY_PATH` to a file containing the key. The key file should be a `*.p8` private key file. (see [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth))
3. Fill out the remaining snowflake connection settings in `.env` (refer to `.env.template` for more details)
4. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### BigQuery

The Talk to my Data Agent supports connecting to BigQuery.

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "bigquery"`.
2. Provide the required google credentials in `.env` dependent on your choice. Ensure that GOOGLE_DB_SCHEMA is also populated in `.env`.
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### SAP Datasphere

The Talk to my Data Agent supports connecting to SAP Datasphere.

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "sap"`.
2. Provide the required SAP credentials in `.env`.
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

### Change the Frontend

The Talk to My Data agent supports two frontend options:

- **React** (default): a modern JavaScript-based frontend with enhanced UI features which uses [FastAPI Backend](app_backend/README.md). See the [React Frontend Development Guide](app_frontend/README.md)
- **Streamlit** (deprecating): A Python-based frontend with a simple interface. See the [Streamlit Frontend Development Guide](frontend/README.md)

To change the frontend:

1. In `.env`: Set `FRONTEND_TYPE="streamlit"` to use the Streamlit frontend instead of the default React.
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up

## Tools

You can help the data analyst python agent by providing tools that can assist with data analysis tasks. For that, define functions in `utils/tools.py`. The function will be made available inside the code execution environment of the agent. The name, docstring and signature will be provided to the agent inside the prompt.

## Share results

1. Log into the DataRobot application.
2. Navigate to **Registry > Applications**.
3. Navigate to the application you want to share, open the actions menu, and select **Share** from the dropdown.

## Delete all provisioned resources

```bash
pulumi down
```

## Setup for advanced users

For manual control over the setup process adapt the following steps for MacOS/Linux to your environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
source set_env.sh
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up
```

e.g. for Windows/conda/cmd.exe this would be:

```bash
conda create --prefix .venv pip
conda activate .\.venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
set_env.bat
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up
```

For projects that will be maintained, DataRobot recommends forking the repo so upstream fixes and improvements can be merged in the future.
